Yes, phones that cost $1,000 or more are expensive. Yes, that‚Äôs outside the budget for most people. But why in the world would anyone argue this is ‚Äùhard to justify‚Äù? Phones are, for most people, the most-used computing device in their lives. They are also their primary‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâusually <em>only</em>‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâcamera. A good camera alone used to cost $500-600.</p>\n\n<p>There are way more people on the planet who‚Äôd rather have a $1,400 phone and a $400 laptop than the other way around.

Hungary is a member state of the European Union and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. It has elections and uncensored internet. Yet Hungary is ceasing to be a free country.</p>\n\n<p>The transition has been nonviolent, often not even very dramatic. Opponents of the regime are not murdered or imprisoned, although many are harassed with building inspections and tax audits. If they work for the government, or for a company susceptible to government pressure, they risk their jobs by speaking out. Nonetheless, they are free to emigrate anytime they like. Those with money can even take it with them. Day in and day out, the regime works more through inducements than through intimidation. The courts are packed, and forgiving of the regime‚Äôs allies. Friends of the government win state contracts at high prices and borrow on easy terms from the central bank. Those on the inside grow rich by favoritism; those on the outside suffer from the general deterioration of the economy. As one shrewd observer told me on a recent visit, ‚ÄúThe benefit of controlling a modern state is less the power to persecute the innocent, more the power to protect the guilty.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>21st century autocracy does not resemble 20th century autocracy.

Watch the whole video‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâWaititi is obviously being a bit glib with the entire premise of his answer, but he‚Äôs not joking. He‚Äôs a writer and writers <em>really</em> care about keyboards.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve been saying for years now that Apple has done severe reputational harm to the MacBook brand, which effectively is the Mac brand for most people, especially writers. Yes, there‚Äôs a new keyboard with scissor-switch mechanisms in the 16-inch MacBook Pro. It‚Äôs <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/16-inch_macbook_pro_first_impressions\">a pleasure to type on</a>. But we‚Äôre still months away from the rest of the MacBook lineup being updated to use that new keyboard. And that‚Äôs a presumption on my part, that all MacBooks will get the new keyboard sooner rather than later. It certainly wouldn‚Äôt make any sense if they didn‚Äôt‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut the whole butterfly-switch saga has never made any sense.</p>\n\n<p>Apple could switch every single Mac in the lineup to the new keyboards tomorrow, and people would still be joking about MacBook keyboards for years to come.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/variety/status/1226710675554091008\">twitter.com/variety/status/1226710675554091008</a></strong></em></p>\n"
